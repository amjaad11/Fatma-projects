       <!-- Provides a description and instructions for performing the Diagonal Raise exercise -->
       <p>Stand with the feet hip-width apart, hold one dumbbell in the left hand with the left arm down straight and the left palm resting in front of the right thigh. Press the feet into the ground, keep the hips straight and the back tall. Raise the left arm across the body and out to the left side so that the weight is brought up to shoulder-height and the arm is kept straight.</p>
