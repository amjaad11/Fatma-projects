        <dt>Bicep Curls:</dt>
        <dd>Bicep Curls is an exercise that targets the front arm muscles (biceps) by bending the elbow and lifting the weight toward the shoulder. The exercise relies on muscle contraction during the lift and relaxation as it returns to the starting position, enhancing its strength and increasing muscle mass. It is an effective exercise for improving the appearance of the arms and boosting muscular performance in daily activities.</dd>
