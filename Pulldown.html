        <dt>Lat Pulldown:</dt>
        <dd>Lat Pulldown is a strength exercise that primarily targets the latissimus dorsi muscles (commonly known as the “lats”), which are the large muscles in the upper back. The exercise involves pulling a resistance down toward the chest while keeping the back straight and shoulders engaged. This motion mimics the action of a pull-up but can be adjusted for different resistance levels, making it accessible to all fitness levels.</dd>
