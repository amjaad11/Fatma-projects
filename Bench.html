         <!-- Defining the Incline Bench Press exercise and its importance -->
        <dt>Incline Bench Press:</dt>
        <dd>The Incline Bench Press is a compound strength exercise that targets the upper chest muscles (pectoralis major, clavicular head) and shoulders (anterior deltoid). It is performed on a bench set at an inclined angle, typically 30-45 degrees, to shift the focus from the lower to the upper part of the chest. This exercise is essential for developing a well-rounded and defined chest.</dl>
