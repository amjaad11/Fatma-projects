            <h2 class="text1">Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Buy “in season” produce which often costs less and is at peak flavor. Buy only what you can use before it spoils. For more info, check out the Seasonal Produce Guide from SNAP-Ed Connection.</li>
                <li>Frozen fruits and vegetables are always "in season." They're picked at peak ripeness and frozen quickly to maintain taste, quality, and nutrients.</li>
                <li>Choose fruits canned in water or 100% fruit juice and vegetables with “low-sodium” or “no salt added” on the label. These products are just as nutritious as fresh, and often cost less.</li>
                <li>Stock up on frozen vegetables without added sauces or butter. Frozen vegetables are as good for you as fresh and may cost less.</li>
                <li>Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables last much longer than fresh. They can be a quick way to add fruits and vegetables to your meal.</li>

        <section>
            <h2 class="text1">Grains</h2>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Make half your grains whole grains. Types of whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, bulgur, buckwheat, oatmeal, whole-grain cornmeal, whole oats, and whole rye.</li>
                <li>While shopping, check ingredient lists and pick the items that have a whole grain listed first.</li>
                <li>Rice and pasta are budget-friendly grain options. Try freezing rice in dinner-sized portions to save time on future meals.</li>
                <li>Choose hot cereals like plain oatmeal or whole-grain dry cereal.</li>
                <li>Try new whole-grain snack ideas, like switching to whole-wheat crackers or popping your own popcorn.</li>
                <li>Many grains are available in the frozen aisle and can be convenient options. Try steam-in-the-bag rice or take-and-bake bread.</li>

        <!-- Section for tips on buying protein-rich foods -->
        <section>
            <h2 class="text1">Protein Foods</h2>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Some low-cost protein foods include beans, peas, and lentils such as kidney beans, lima beans, split peas, and garbanzo beans (chickpeas).</li>
                <li>Beans, peas, and lentils cost less than a similar amount of other protein foods.</li>
                <li>To lower meat costs, buy the family-sized or value pack and freeze what you don't use.</li>
                <li>Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey. When choosing ground beef, make sure it's lean (at least 93% lean/fat-free).</li>
                <li>Seafood doesn’t have to cost a lot. Try buying canned tuna, salmon, or sardines. These items store well and are a low-cost option.</li>
                <li>Don’t forget about eggs! They’re a great low-cost option that’s easy to make.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text1">Dairy</h2>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Choose low-fat or fat-free milk. These have just as much calcium, but fewer calories than whole and 2% milk.</li>
                <li>Buy the larger size of low-fat plain yogurt instead of single flavored yogurt. Then add your own flavors by mixing in fruits.</li>
                <li>Choose cheese products with "reduced fat" or "low-fat" on the label.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text1">Other Tips</h2>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Drink water instead of sodas or other high-sugar drinks. Water is easy on your wallet and has zero calories. Take a reusable water bottle when on the go.</li>
                <li>Save time, money, and calories by skipping the chip and cookie aisles.</li>
                <li>Choose the checkout lane without the candy shelves, especially if you have kids with you.</li>
