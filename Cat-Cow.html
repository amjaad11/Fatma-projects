        <dt>Body Part:</dt>
        <dd>Back, Chest</dd>
        <dt>Step 1</dt>
        <dd>Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).</dd>
        <dt>Step 2</dt>
        <dd>Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your hands facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.</dd>
        <dt>Step 3</dt>
        <dd>Gently stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoiding any sagging or arching.</dd>
        <dt>Step 4</dt>
        <dd>Upward (Cat) Phase: Gently exhale and contract your abdominal muscles, pushing your spine upwards towards the ceiling and hold this position for 10 - 15 seconds. Allow your head to fall towards your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine.</dd>
        <dt>Step 5</dt>
        <dd>Downward (Cow) Phase: Slowly relax and yield to the effects of gravity. Let your stomach fall towards the floor (increasing the arch in your low back) and allow your shoulder blades to fall together (move towards the spine). Hold this position for 10 - 15 seconds before returning to your starting position</dd>
