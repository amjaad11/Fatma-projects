# Health and Fitness Website
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/-r211TWqccM?si=YO80xpVXkCCq_lqp
#### Description:
My project is a health and fitness website that provides comprehensive information about health and exercise, focusing on the upper and lower body areas.
### Explanation of the Features in the Code for the Homepage.html Exercise
This is a health website that provides general health information and exercise routines targeting the lower and upper body.

Features:
1. Details
I used the <details> element to create a list of the site’s content that can be expanded and collapsed. Initially, I made it open using the open attribute.

2. Summary
I used the <summary> element to display section titles on the site. For example, in my site, I have section titles for the lower body, upper body, and various health information, and it displayed them in the desired format.

3. Li
(List Items) I used the <li> element to create the topic lists that I added to my site.

4. A (Links)
I used the <a href="..."> element to direct users to the different pages on the site.

5. Div with Class “Parent”
I used <div class="parent"> to style the page, provide a welcoming message, and make it visually appealing and consistent. This is linked to the CSS file for additional styling.

6.	Footer with Class “Footer”
I used <footer class="footer"> to welcome everyone visiting my site and used a class to apply a specific design to the footer through CSS.


Here is an explanation of the health.css file linked to the main page:
1.	margin: 0: Removed the default margins created by the page so that I can use the entire page of my website.

2.	width: 250px: Description: I set the width to be suitable for my page, 250 pixels.

3.	background-image: url(aa33.jpg): I added a background image to the site to make it visually appealing and comfortable.

4.	background-size: cover: Description: This makes the background image fully cover the element without any unwanted empty spaces.

5.	background-repeat: repeat: Prevents the image from repeating because the site automatically repeats it into multiple images.
6. Details summary:
I have added a color to the menus and a color for the links before clicking on them. After clicking, they have a different color.
