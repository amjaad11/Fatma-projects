        <!-- Description of the exercise, explaining the movement and targeted muscles -->
        <dd id="text4">Chest Fly is a strength exercise that primarily targets the chest muscles (pectoralis major) by mimicking a “hugging” motion. It involves extending the arms outward and then bringing them together in front of the body while keeping the elbows slightly bent. This movement helps stretch and contract the chest muscles, enhancing muscle definition and flexibility.</dd>
