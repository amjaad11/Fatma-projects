       <dt>Vitamin D and depression</dt>
       <!-- Highlights key research findings -->
       <dd>A 2018 study found that many people who have depression also have low blood levelsTrusted Source of vitamin D, indicating a possible connection.
        Research also indicates an association between depression and low vitamin D levels in people with postpartum depression.
        A small, high quality 2020 study of 56 participants with mild to moderate depression found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with an improvementTrusted Source in depression severity over 8 weeks.
        This potential benefit in the long term, however, isn’t completely clear.
        A large, high quality 2020 study of more than 18,000 people with depression found that taking 2,000 international units (IU) per day of vitamin D for 5 years didn’t lead toTrusted Source significant differences in depression scores compared with a placebo.</dd>
    <dt>More research is needed to determine how:</dt>

    <li>taking vitamin D supplements might affect depression symptoms</li>

    <li>skin tone</li>
    <dt>Diet</dt>
    <dd>Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin DTrusted Source. You can increase your intake by eating more of these great natural sources of vitamin D:</dd>
    <li>salmon, mackerel, other fatty fish</li>
    <li>fish liver oils</li>
    <li>animal fats</li>
    <li>vitamin D-fortified food products such as orange juice, cereal, mushrooms</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <dt>If you follow a vegetarian diet, vegan and vegetarian vitamin D sources include:</dt>
    <li>fortified plant-based milk</li>
    <li>fruit juices</li>
    <li>grain products</li>
    <li>ultraviolet (UV) light-exposed mushrooms</li>
    <dt>Darker skin tone</dt>
    <dd>In the United States, Black people tend to be at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency than other populations.
        This disparity may be because people with darker skin have more melanin, a natural skin pigment that may inhibit vitamin D productionTrusted Source in the skin.
        One study using data from a large U.S. health study from 2011 to 2014 found that 17.5% of Black people were at risk for vitamin D deficiency compared with:</dd>
    <li>7.6% of Asian people</li>
    <li>2.1% of white people</li>
    <li>5.9% of Hispanic people</li>
    <li>If you’re concerned about your vitamin D production from sun exposure, talk with your doctor about what you can do.</li>
    <dl>Distance from the equator</dl>
    <dd>Studies have shown that people living in northern latitudes, such as the northern half of the U.S., may be more likely to have lower vitamin D levels, especially during the winter when less sunlight is available.

Older adults may limit their time in the sun and eat diets with insufficient amounts of vitamin D, putting them at higher risk for a deficiencyTrusted Source in this vitamin.As you get older, your skin becomes less efficient at producing vitamin D.
