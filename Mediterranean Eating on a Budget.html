            <h3>Foods to Include Every Day</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Whole grains: 1 to 2 servings per meal</li>
                <li>Vegetables: at least 2 servings at lunch and dinner, including 1 raw</li>

                <li>Poultry: 2 servings per week</li>
                <li>Red and processed meats: 1 serving per week (i.e., rarely consumed)</li>
                <li>Eggs: 2 to 4 times per week</li>
                <li>Beans and lentils: most common protein sources</li>
                <li>Low saturated fats - less than 7-8 percent of total energy
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nuts (e.g., walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts; high in heart-healthy poly- and monounsaturated fats): 1 ounce per day</li>
                        <li>Fish (e.g., salmon, sardines, tuna; high in omega-3 fats): 4-ounce serving 2 times per week, as recommended by the American Heart Association</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
             <!-- Section about plant-based spreads -->
            <h3>Spreads</h3>
            <p>Another way the Mediterranean diet enhances nutrition is by including plant-based "spreads" instead of deli or processed meats with butter, margarine, or mayonnaise. One spread is olive tapenade, a finely chopped olive-based mixture that can be made from minced ripe olives or green olives.
            Fava is a dish made from pureed cooked yellow split peas or fava beans. This common side dish at meals is passed in small bowls as you would pass butter.
            A dish called eggplant salad, served in Greece and Turkey, is actually a dip of mashed or pureed roasted eggplant with olive oil and seasonings. A similar food in Arabic countries is referred to as Baba Ghanouj, though it frequently includes tomato and onion. These spreads add nutrients and fiber to the meal while limiting solid fats.
            A variety of plant-based spreads are used with whole-grain breads, crackers, and barley rusks (slices of dried barley bread), which are very popular in the Mediterranean.

            <h3>Healthy Fats</h3>
            <p>As a percentage of calories, the fat content of the Mediterranean diet varies from 25 to 40 percent depending on the geographical region. This would qualify as a low- to moderate-fat diet. Current research shows that this is a beneficial level of fat, adding fullness and satiety to a meal. In Mediterranean counties, more olive oil is consumed, whereas Americans generally eat more saturated fat from animal sources. Olive oil has a variety of fatty acid types making up the oil, mostly monounsaturated. This fits with the current U.S. Dietary Guidelines to consume less than 10 percent saturated fat. Other foods that contribute to healthy fats include nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and seafood.</p>
